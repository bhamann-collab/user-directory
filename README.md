# User Directory
An application that views the entire employee directory. You can sort the names alphabetically from ascending order to descending order.

## Deployment on GitHub
https://bhamann-collab.github.io/user-directory/
I was unable to get react working with github static pages. 

## Missing functionality
Functionality of filtering occupation is not operational. My plan was to have an onChange property on the filter input that executes a function in the App.js component that filters out the array that eventually maps out to "Employee" components.
